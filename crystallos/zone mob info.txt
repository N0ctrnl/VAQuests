999999 - #Crumble

Ring of ice golems moves to crumble and he absorbs them and grows

every 5% he "crumbles" (max damage decreases, he shrinks), and 2 adds spawn.  Chunk of black ice (low hp easy to kill, but very nasty AE hp/mana drain in large area) which should be either rooted away from everyone or mezzed.
other add is a "chunk of ice" hit hard but relatively low hp, however upon death 1-6 add spawn on death they are water droplets, they have insane dps, but can be killed with a decent AE spell

at 50%, 4 shards of ice spawn, as long as they are up they will send healing waters to crumble, which will heal him some if they reach him, they are not targetable.
the shards of ice need to be killed to stop the healing.

once you reach 10% adds will come every 2% until Crumble is dead
